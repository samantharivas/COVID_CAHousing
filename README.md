# Impact Assessment on California Home Prices Post COVID-19
## SARIMA Home Prices Forecasting

### Overview

This research embarks on an exploration of the intricate effects of the pandemic on the housing markets, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of its impact on California home prices. The complex interplay between public health measures, policy interventions, and technological advancements and its effects on the housing market are unraveled.

The primary objective of this study is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on California home prices by creating a forecasting model using both statewide and county-level data. The current state reveals a real estate sector navigating through economic uncertainties, influenced by fluctuations in market conditions, government interventions, and evolving consumer preferences. A macro-level view is captured through the statewide average home price, while a more comprehensive understanding is gained by individual county-level data.

This project focuses on forecasting home prices using Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models for various counties in California. The goal is to analyze historical data, build SARIMA models, and forecast future home prices to understand the impact of external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic on real estate markets.

### Project Structure

#### Data Collection and Preprocessing

The project utilizes historical data on median prices of existing detached homes in various counties of California. The dataset was sourced from the California Association of Realtors (CAR), spanning from January 1990 to September 2023. Data preprocessing involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing the dataset for time series analysis. This includes handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring consistency across different counties.

#### SARIMA Modeling

For each selected county (e.g., Los Angeles, San Diego), SARIMA models are fitted to the training data to capture seasonality, trends, and other patterns in home prices. Model selection and parameter tuning are based on the characteristics observed in the data during exploratory data analysis.

#### Results and Insights

The forecasts generated by SARIMA models are compared with actual home prices to assess model performance. Insights are drawn regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other external factors on the real estate market dynamics of each county. This analysis helps in understanding how different regions in California were affected differently by the pandemic and economic changes.

### Conclusion

The project concludes with a comprehensive analysis of SARIMA model performance across different counties in California, providing insights into the variability and forecastability of home prices in response to economic changes and crises. Recommendations for stakeholders in the real estate industry are based on these findings.
